Re-read the instructions for the project. Read the .txt and .pl files to understand what I would need.
I planned some of the functions that I will need like a map validation function for the "bad" maps that should not work.

I have created the .pl file and started writing a carcass for my map validation function, as well as I created an empty "solve" function to encapsulate all the logic for moving around the maze. After I have finished the validation function I will work on the movement. I believeworking the validation first will give me a better idea of how to solve the movement logic. Once I have it I will move it inside the solve logic(). I also watched a couple of videos on prologue syntax.

Almost done with the validation of map funtion. The basic rules so far are as follows: 
Maze cannot be empty, cannt have rows with varying sizes, must have one start, must have one exit.
